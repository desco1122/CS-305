# **CS-305 Software Security**

*Client and Software Requirements*

Artemis Financial is a financial services company that provides banking, investment, and insurance services to its customers. The company has a number of software applications that it uses to support its business operations. For this assignment, Artemis Financial wanted me to assess the security and development of their customer portal. This application is used by customers to access their accounts, view their balances, and make transactions.

*Finding Vulnerabilities*

I used a variety of tools and techniques to find vulnerabilities. I started by manually reviewing the code for potential security issues. I also used a number of automated vulnerability scanners to identify known vulnerabilities in the software. Once I had identified a number of vulnerabilities, I evaluated their severity and risk and deployed dependency checks to mitigate any issues.

*Coding Securely*

It is important to code securely because software vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems and data. Software security is important for all companies, but it is especially important for financial services companies like Artemis Financial. Coding securely adds value to a company's overall well-being by protecting its customers' data and financial assets. It can also help to avoid costly regulatory fines and reputational damage.

*Challenges and Helpful Tips*

One of the challenging aspects of the vulnerability assessment was understanding the complex codebase. I also found it challenging to evaluate the severity of some of the vulnerabilities that I found. However, I found it helpful to use a variety of tools and resources to learn more about the codebase and the vulnerabilities that I found. I also found it helpful to read about any common issues using a related textbook.

*Increasing Security Layers*

One way to increase layers of security is to implement a defense-in-depth approach. This means implementing multiple layers of security controls so that if one layer is compromised, the others can still protect the system. Another way to increase security layers is to use security best practices and standards. These best practices and standards provide guidance on how to develop and deploy secure software.

*Assessing Vulnerabilities and Mitigation Techniques*

In the future, I would use a variety of tools and techniques to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use. I would also consult with other security professionals to get their input. Some of the tools and techniques that I would use include:

- Automated vulnerability scanners: These scanners can identify known vulnerabilities in software.
- Manual code review: This involves manually reviewing the code for potential security issues.
- Security testing tools: These tools can be used to test the security of software applications.
- I would also consult with other security professionals to get their input on the vulnerabilities that I find and the mitigation techniques that I am considering.

*Ensuring Functionality and Security*

To ensure that the code and software application are functional and secure, I would start by testing the code to ensure that it meets the functional requirements. I would also use security testing tools to test the security of the application. After refactoring the code, I would check to see whether I introduced new vulnerabilities by using the same testing techniques that I used before refactoring.

*Helpful Resources, Tools, and Coding Practices*

- Security documentation: This documentation provides guidance on how to develop and deploy secure software.
- Security testing tools: These tools can be used to test the security of software applications.
- Security best practices and standards: These provide guidance on how to develop and deploy secure software.
- Secure coding practices: These practices can help to prevent the introduction of security vulnerabilities into code.

*What I Might Show Future Employers*

From this assignment, I could show future employers the following:

- My ability to assess the security of software applications.
- My knowledge of security best practices and standards.
- My ability to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities.
- My ability to work independently and as part of a team.
